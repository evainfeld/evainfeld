  TL/DR: </br>
	If you're gonna check out one tech project, go with <a href="https://impakt.network">IMPAKT</a>. </br>
	If you are looking for a sample math paper, try <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.03418.pdf">Uniform Avoidance Coupling of Simple Random Walks</a>.</br>
	For sample teaching materials, either <a href="m314.html">Discrete Mathematics for Engineers</a> or <a href="m20.html">Probability</a> will do fine.</br>
  If you need computer and operational security advice, but start with the wonderful resources by the <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>.

There's a short blurb below, but I made a more thorough <a href="family.html">page about my family's academic legacy</a>, because I'm, well, coping.

	 <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.03418.pdf">Uniform Avoidance Coupling of Simple Random Walks</a> - is it possible to check if you can program two tokens to walk on a graph s that they never collide BUT if you only see one it looks like a simple random walk? For some graphs we can, and I found an algorithm to test whether you have one of these graphs. In polynomial time! </br></br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IN2PKA1xb4Q">Combinatorics and k-anonymity </a> A theoretical reason k-anonimity is a good way to construct anonymity sets - rather than just what we know how to do in practice. </br></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07111">The Total Acquisition Number of Random Geometric Graphs</a> (with Mitsche, Prałat)  </br></br><a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/foci14/foci14-infeld.pdf"> Symmetric Disclosure: a Fresh Look at k-Anonymity</a> FOCI'14, with <a href="https://2459d6dc103cb5933875-c0245c5c937c5dedcca3f1764ecc9b2f.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/foci14/infeld.mp4">presentation video</a>. Social networks are very sparse, so k-anonymity gives very little cover traffic for communications unless we group users in rather large sets. This is an often ignored problem.

<img src="images/herby.jpg" width="95%" align="center"></br></br>WHY I QUIT ACADEMIA</br></br>
Needless to say, I didn't last in academia. The reasons are largely the same as they are for most would-be professors in my generation: it just wasn't worth the struggle.</br></br>
But like most, I found that it is easier to make an impact and work on solving the problems that matter once I quit.</br></br>It's the hacker world that taught me intellectual courage, not academia. The most liberating thing I ever learned was to not wait for permission or validation to work on solving a problem. Especially when it comes to the big problems. It's hackers, not academics, who shoot for the sky.

    <p class="text_column"> COMPUTER SECURITY AND PRIVACY</br></br> Much of my political work is empowering the public to resist surveillance. While the corrupt economic system may be a more fundamental problem, surveillance and every day control is an obstacle to us finding solutions. It is having profound effects on our social structure and solidifying destructive power systems worldwide.</br><font color="#52BAD5" size="2px"></br>INFORMATION IS POWER, PRIVACY IS FREEDOM.</br></font></br> And as a mathematician and hacker, this is where I feel most empowered to effect change. I provide computer and operational security assistance to progressive organizations and NGOs. Let me know if you need help.
 </p>
    <p class="text_column">POLITICS</br></br> I've been proud to provide support and take part in many progressive political campaigns. I believe in freedom. There is no freedom without economic security. I believe a large scale reversal to wealth theft is necessary, and needs to go together with a redistribution of power.</br></br>
In the past I've been involved with the American Civil Liberties Union, Bernie2016 campaign, the Stop C-51 iniatitive in Canada, polish progressive movement Razem and many hacktivist causes.

	<p class="text_column">FAMILY </br></br>There is plenty on the web on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_Infeld">Leopold Infeld</a>'s legacy as scientist, educator and peace activist. <a href="http://www.fiatphysica.com/theoretical-physics/grandfather-einstein/">My Grandfather and Einstein</a>, a guest post I wrote for Fiat Physica may serve as an intro. Also, here is the full text of <a href="https://ia800302.us.archive.org/15/items/evolutionofphysi033254mbp/evolutionofphysi033254mbp.pdf"> The Evolution of Physics </a> by A. Einstein and L. Infeld, as well as the text of the <a href="https://pugwash.org/1955/07/09/statement-manifesto/">Russel-Einstein Manifesto</a>, which remains relevant today.</br></br>
    Some day I hope to upload scans of my grandfather Leopold's correspondence with Einstein, but there's a lot of it. In the meantime, here is a bit of history in are letters from <a href="letters/joliot.pdf">Frederic Joliot-Curie</a>, <a href="letters/russel.pdf">Bertrand Russel</a> and <a href="letters/kissinger.pdf">Henry Kissinger</a>.
</br></br>
My other grandfather is the Polish writer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Józef_Hen">Józef Hen</a>.</br></br>My grandmother Helen Schlauch (later Infeld) recieved <a href="https://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=42785">a PhD in Mathematics at Cornell</a> at a time when few women pursued mathematics and her sister <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Schlauch">Margaret Schlauch</a> was a pioneering linguist whose work is still relevant today.

Together with my partner we dealt with the pandemic in a somewhat irresponsible way - we took advantage of it to spend time in places that 
would otherwise be crowded and prohibitively expensive, most notably French Polynesia. I documented some of it int this <a href="https://piratesofsouthpacific.github.io"> travel blog.</a> You can judge but we have no regrets.
